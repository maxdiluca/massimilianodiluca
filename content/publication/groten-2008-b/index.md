abstract: 'In this work, we analyze whether oscillatory motion between two extreme
  positions could be used to create a robotic dancing partner that provides natural
  haptic feedback. To this end, we compared the pattern of hand movements performed
  following a pacing signal while participants were instructed to either move rhythmically
  or to dance. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of the frequency and type of
  pacing signal on the two kinds of movements. Trajectories were analyzed in terms
  of: frequency of movement, spatial and temporal synchronization, and jerk. Results
  indicate that it is easier to perform synchronized movements while dancing, even
  though these movements partially deviate from the pacing frequency. Dance movements
  are in fact more complex than the ones produced to keep the rhythm and for this
  reason they should be modeled accordingly in order to provide realistic haptic feedback.
