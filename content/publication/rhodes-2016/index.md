abstract: It's reasonable to assume that a regularly paced sequence should be perceived
  as regular, but here we show that perceived regularity depends on the context in
  which the sequence is embedded. We presented one group of participants with perceptually
  regularly paced sequences, and another group of participants with mostly irregularly
  paced sequences (75% irregular, 25% regular). The timing of the final stimulus in
  each sequence could be varied. In one experiment, we asked whether the last stimulus
  was regular or not. We found that participants exposed to an irregular environment
  frequently reported perfectly regularly paced stimuli to be irregular. In a second
  experiment, we asked participants to judge whether the final stimulus was presented
  before or after a flash. In this way, we were able to determine distortions in temporal
  perception as changes in the timing necessary for the sound and the flash to be
  perceived synchronous. We found that within a regular context, the perceived timing
  of deviant last stimuli changed so that the relative anisochrony appeared to be
  perceptually decreased. In the irregular context, the perceived timing of irregular
  stimuli following a regular sequence was not affected. These observations suggest
  that humans use temporal expectations to evaluate the regularity of sequences and
  that expectations are combined with sensory stimuli to adapt perceived timing to
  follow the statistics of the environment. Expectations can be seen as a-priori probabilities
  on which perceived timing of stimuli depend.
