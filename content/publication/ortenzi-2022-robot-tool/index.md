abstract: 'Research has shown that the relationship between robot mind, body, and identity is flexible and can be performed in a variety of ways. Our research explores how identity performance strategies used among robot groups may be presented through group identity observables (design cues), and how those strategies impact human-robot interactions. Specifically, we ask how group identity observables lead observers to develop different mental models of robot groups, and different perceptions of trust and group dynamics constructs.'
